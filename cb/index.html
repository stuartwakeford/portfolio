              <p>Charlie’s consultation service offers you the flexibility to seek expert advice at any point during your project, whether you're just starting out or need guidance on specific challenges as your project progresses.<br><br>

              The time can be used to discuss any interior design issues you may have, for example:</p>
              
                <ul class="bullets">    
                    <li>Optimising your space and room layout</li>
                    <li>Choosing colour schemes, paint colours, and material finishes</li>
                    <li>Selecting the right furniture and storage solutions</li>
                    <li>Window treatments, flooring and lighting</li>
                    <li>Styling and finishing touches</li>
                </ul>
            

              <p>Prior to your meeting you’ll be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire. Based on this Charlie will research and prepare, ensuring you get the most from your time together during the consultation.</p>
              
              <p>If you would like to move forward with additional design services the consultation cost will be deducted from the final fee.</p>
              
              <p>Consultations are available in-person or via video call, depending on location. Travel costs are charged for in-person meetings beyond Brighton & Hove. </p>

              <p>"We worked with Charlie to realise the interior design and layout of our rear extension and adjoining kitchen / diner. Charlie really listened to what we were trying to achieve with the space, posing questions we had not yet considered regarding how we would be utilising the rooms and the mood we were hoping to create. She was sensitive to budget, proposing a variety of options that would incorporate the various scenarios we were discussing with our builder. She presented us a great number of designs for consideration and we are thrilled with the final route chosen which has totally elevated the space in a way we didn't think was possible. I would thoroughly recommend Charlie for her creative, professional and considered approach to design - she was a joy to work with."</p>

            <p>"Charlie designed a bedroom for me when I moved into a new build flat with a totally blank canvas and I can’t recommend her highly enough. 
The whole process was a pleasure, starting with the initial discussions where Charlie wanted to get an understanding of my budget, ideas and goals for the space; through to the collaboration, discussion and evolution during the design process.
Charlie was very flexible, willing to think outside the box and shared options with me to suit different budgets and aesthetics, which was really helpful especially when starting from scratch! She was willing to work with me and make adjustments as we went through the process, always being positive and consultative. She was able to bring a vague concept I had in my head to life and I’ve been super happy with the results… so much so that I’ve asked her to help on another room I’m looking to upgrade."</p>

              <p>"I cannot recommend Charlie highly enough, as she’s provided me with the highest level of service from beginning to end. Charlie is clearly very passionate about interior design, which comes across in her approach to helping you bring your design from concept to reality. I personally loved her attention to detail and the use of 3D imagery to help bring my ‘ideas to life’, which helped me make some crucial decisions. My house has become my own thanks to her guidance and expertise. Thank you."</p>

            <p>"If we're honest our open plan dining and living room lacked any real character before we met Charlie and as a result we spent very little time there. We knew we wanted something different but we didn't know what and never had time to give it our full attention. The moment Charlie sat down with us it felt like a relief. We loved how easy the whole process was.  If you've got ideas she'll run with those, if you need ideas she'll ask the right questions to get you thinking. When Charlie came back with the designs it was so exciting. The end result was incredible. Charlie exceeded both of our expectations. Two very happy customers."</p>

              <p>"We initially asked Charlie to help when we had our loft extended and our children's rooms redecorated. We didn't know where to start so Charlie's help was invaluable! She took the time to get to know us and really consider what we wanted. She understood our preferences and what we were trying to achieve. Charlie was brilliant to work with - friendly, understanding, thoughtful and flexible. I loved all her ideas and it was easy to imagine the new rooms with the ideas she had given us. We have also recently asked for help with our living room. Charlie really understood what we wanted and now the room has been decorated, I absolutely love it! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Charlie to anyone needing an interior designer."</p>

              <p>"I asked Charlie to design a therapeutic space to hold psychology sessions for children and families.
                  Charlie really captured the vision I had for the space. She listened to my hopes for how the space would be used and make people feel.
                  She was able to bring my ideas to life and created a space that I could never have put together without her input. She was so skilled at making the most of the space I had and made so many invaluable suggestions, thinking of details which made such a difference to the space. 
                  I would highly recommend working with Charlie for her professionalism, style, knowledge and creativity."</p>
